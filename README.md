This Plugin is intended for use with the Escargot service at https://escargot.chat

Keep in mind that this fork only fixed a sign-in issue and I won't provide any support whatsoever. You're on your own, kid. Tested it on macOS, I've heard that people were successful in compiling it on Linux. For Windows... just use the goddamn client.

Compared to libpurple's stock plug-in:

 * Faster log-in
 * Fewer crashes
 * Fewer connection issues
 * Support for direct file transfers
 * Support for winks (animoticons) (view-only) (Pidgin)
 * Support for Plus! sounds (receive-only)
 * Option to hide Plus! tags

Other features (which the stock plug-in also has):

 * No timeout issues
 * Server-side storage for display names (private alias)
 * Support for personal status messages
 * Support for offline messaging
 * Send custom emoticons (Pidgin >= 2.5)
 * Support for handwritten messages (read-only)
 * Support for voice clips (receive-only)

Future plans:

 * MSNP18 support
